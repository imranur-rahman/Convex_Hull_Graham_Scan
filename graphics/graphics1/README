OpenGL 1.x

------------------------------------------------
2D

simple1
	 draws a white filled rectangle on a black background
simple2
	draws a rectangle with vertices of different colors; note the color
	blending done by OpenGL, this is called smooth shading, and it's the
	default. 
simple3
	 draws a pattern with lines, points and polygons 
simple4
	draw an n-gon with n vertices. 
	Features:
	- number of vertices can be increased/decreased  with <,>
   	- the radius can be increased/decreased with +, -
    	- moving left/right/up/dpwn when the user presses l/r/u/d keys
	The movement is implemented by applying a translation to move the
	local coordinate system.
simple5
	same as simple4, but demonstrates a timerfunc(). 
	

------------------------------------------------
3D

simple6
	draws a cube in 3D
simple7
	simple6 + moving l/r/u/d and rotations x/X/y/Y/z/Z.
